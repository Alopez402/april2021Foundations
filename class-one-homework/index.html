    <h1>Resell is life</h1>
    This is my website based off of buying and reselling shoes. <b>The hype is real!!!</b>
    <p>
        My Name is Abraham, When i was in highschool I started collection
        and reselling shoes. It was crazy a pair of Jordans that retail 
        at $180 were reselling at $300+. Being that they were such a limited 
        item people would start camping out at the mall at the night before
        release day.
